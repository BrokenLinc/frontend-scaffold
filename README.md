# frontend-scaffold

An accessible collection of front-end snippets to help kick-start web projects. Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [LessJS](https://http://lesscss.org).

This is **not** a project boilerplate. It does not contain production-level optimizations. It is built to by easy to read and easy to copy-and-paste pieces into your project. I hope you find it helpful!

See the [demo site](https://landerson352.github.io/frontend-scaffold/public/).
